done changes you’ve never used git or github before, there are a bunch of things that you need to do. It’s very well explained on github, but repeated here for completeness.

Get a github account.
Download and install git.
Set up git with your user name and email.

Open a terminal/shell and type:

$ git config --global user.name Your name here
$ git config --global user.email your_email@example.com
(Don’t type the $; that just indicates that you’re doing this at the command line.)

I also do:

$ git config --global color.ui true
$ git config --global core.editor emacs
The first of these will enable colored output in the terminal; the second tells git that you want to use emacs.
