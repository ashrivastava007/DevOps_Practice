Received offer letter today

From TCS INDORE today right now

$ git config --global user.name Your name here
$ git config --global user.email your_email@example.com
(Don’t type the $; that just indicates that you’re doing this at the command line.)

I also do:

$ git config --global color.ui true
$ git config --global core.editor emacs
The first of these will enable colored output in the terminal; the second tells git that you want to use emacs.
